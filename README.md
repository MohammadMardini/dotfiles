# Vim setup

This repo contains runcom and profile files for Vim, Bash etc. but is primarily for my Vim setup.

Includes colours and plugins installed with vundle.


## Vim top tips

#### Console window

`q:` will open a console window

#### Fix formatting

`=` select a block of text and press `=`

#### Marks
`ma` set a mark called `a`

`mz` set a mark called `z`

---

`` `a `` jump to mark `a`

`` `z `` jump to mark `z`

---

`'a` jump to start of line for mark `a`

`'z` jump to start of line for mark `z`

#### Insert text on multiple lines
`Ctrl` + `v` to select a column then `shift` + `I` to enter the text. Press `Esc` shows inserted text.
